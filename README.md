Naturally, I work on a thought of when I was young with my father again, and it is on this road.
My most fields on either side of the road, often harvest season, mother took the harvest of crops to the side of the road, and then made by cart pulled by his father and went home.
Understanding the parents at an early age I always go to help also, things to do, just behind the father.
My father has said little, afraid I tired, vicious in the front.
And I've always thought... father, vicious in the push, so our trolley has been running very fast.
He is always in the front, said: "slow down!
Slow down!"
I also kept behind promised, but finally won't slow down the speed of the car.
Nightfall, disseminated under the pillow, hole in the pocket, bag, the big loss of morning glory of a woman is mother thrown out of the door.
